changed strcat

cut, copy, paste all or part of a line. (any keys)

• Write AND edit a command over a few lines. In that case, we would love that ctrl+UP and ctrl+DOWN allow to go from one line to another in the command while remaining in the same column or otherwise the most appropriate column.

• Implement the ctrl+D and ctrl+C combination feature (knowing that ctrl+C to stop a program is a good thing too).
